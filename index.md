  Hi! My name is Samuel Jacob Leibowitz, but everyone calls me Sam, or Sammy, or occasionally Sammy Baby.
  I'm a software engineer/architect, working in the healthcare industry, primarily behavioral health.

  Uh... look, let's be honest here. I've just moved into the place and things aren't quite settled. Tell you what: today is 31 May, 2021. If I haven't replaced this placeholder with _something_ within the next couple of weeks, you can come and [hassle me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeibowitzSam).
